# Blog Laravel & Next.js Tutorial

This repository contains the code for a blog project built with Laravel 11 (back-end) and Next.js 14 (front-end).

## About the Course

This project serves as the foundation for a complete tutorial series on YouTube, where we will walk through each step of building a modern blog with Laravel as an API and Next.js for the front-end. The project will be started from scratch during the course, so you can follow along and learn how the development process unfolds.

Feel free to clone or fork this repository to follow along, or to refer back to it as you build your own projects.
